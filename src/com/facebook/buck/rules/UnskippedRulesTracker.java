/**
 * Keeps track of the number of build rules that either were already executed or might be executed
 * in the future. This class assumes that a rule that was not yet executed might be executed in the
 * future if either there is a dependency path from a top level rule to this rule such that no rule
 * on the path was yet executed or the rule is a runtime dependency of a rule fulfilling the
 * previous condition. This model is consistent with {@link CachingBuildEngine}'s shallow build
 * mode. The class uses reference counting to efficiently keep track of those rules.
