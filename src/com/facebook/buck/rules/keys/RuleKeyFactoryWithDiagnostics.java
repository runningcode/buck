   *
   * <p>The provided custom hasher is used for all the elements hashed under this rule or

   *
   * <p>Note however that if the factory chooses to hash nested build rules and appendables
   * separately, and only include their final hash for the computation of this hash, this choice
   * applies both to real rule keys and the diagnostic keys. The client may need to perform a
   * separate call for each build rule or appendable of interest. Moreover, the hash for the nested
   * build rules and appendables is obtained by using the default hasher and not the provided custom
   * hasher. This is the natural choice as it allows the custom hasher to see precisely those
   * elements that the default hasher sees. It is also more efficient because factories usually
   * cache rule keys computed with the default hasher, whereas using the custom hasher prevents that
   * and would require hashing all of its transitive dependencies.
