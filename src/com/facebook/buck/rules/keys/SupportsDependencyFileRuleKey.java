   * <p>The main purpose of this predicate is to support scenarios where compiler decides whether to
   * use a file or not solely based on its path. Of course, if compiler decides to use the file, it
   * should list it in the dep-file in which case both the path and the content will be included in
   * the rule key. However, relying only on presence in the dep-file for such paths is not
   * sufficient. The problem occurs when a new such file just gets added, in which case it won't be
   * present in the dep-file produced in the previous build, and yet if we run a local build now the
   * compiler may decide to use it. For that reason rule key needs to reflect existence of all such
   * files and change when a such a file gets added or removed.
