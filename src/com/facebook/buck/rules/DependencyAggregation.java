/**
 * A noop build rule used to aggregate dependencies shared amongst many rules.
 *
 * <p>In cases where many rules require largely the same sets of dependencies, such as cxx
 * compilation of files in a target, explicitly copying the dependencies to every such rule imposes
 * slow down and memory usage proportional to the number of rules that share a dependency set. This
 * class curtails the copying of all shared dependencies between rules, and instead allow each rule
 * to depend on this single rule, which captures the shared dependencies.
 *
 * <p>This class is distinct from {@link NoopBuildRule} to make clear the requirements for its
 * operation, namely, that it cannot be cached. This rule must not be cached in order for its
 * dependencies to always be evaluated in different build strategies (in particular, top-down).
