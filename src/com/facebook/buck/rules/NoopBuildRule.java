/**
 * A {@link com.facebook.buck.rules.BuildRule} which has no output. This is used in the following
 * ways:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>When a target has multiple potential outputs (e.g. a CxxLibrary may be static or shared).
 *       Flavored versions of the target will actually do work (and be depended on) in the action
 *       graph. However, the target graph to action graph conversion assumes that every node in the
 *       target graph will have a corresponding node in the action graph, so we create a
 *       NoopBuildRule to keep to that constraint, even though the actual work is done by the
 *       flavored versions.
 *   <li>When a target has no output artifacts, but its exit code may be interesting. e.g. {@link
 *       com.facebook.buck.rules.TestRule}s may not have any build steps to perform, but have
 *       runTests Steps to run to determine their exit code.
 *   <li>When a target just forwards an existing file, e.g. for prebuilt library rules, or if all
 *       the work is actually done on a depending rule (e.g. Lua).
 * </ol>
