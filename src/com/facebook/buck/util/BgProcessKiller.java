    // We kill subprocesses by sending SIGHUP to our process group; we want our subprocesses to die
    // on SIGHUP while we ourselves stay around.  We can't just set SIGHUP to SIG_IGN, because
    // subprocesses would inherit the SIG_IGN signal disposition and be immune to the SIGHUP we
    // direct toward the process group.  We need _some_ signal handler that does nothing --- i.e.,
    // acts like SIG_IGN --- but that doesn't kill its host process.  When we spawn a subprocess,
    // the kernel replaces any signal handler that is not SIG_IGN with SIG_DFL, automatically
    // creating the signal handler configuration we want.
    //
    // getpid might seem like a strange choice of signal handler, but consider the following:
    //
    //   1) on all supported ABIs, calling a function that returns int as if it returned void is
    //      harmless --- the return value is stuffed into a register (for example, EAX on x86
    //      32-bit) that the caller ignores (EAX is caller-saved),
    //
    //   2) on all supported ABIs, calling a function with extra arguments is safe --- the callee
    //      ignores the extra arguments, which are passed either in caller-saved registers or in
    //      stack locations that the caller [1] cleans up upon return,
    //
    //   3) getpid is void(*)(int); signal handlers are void(*)(int), and
    //
    //   4) getpid is async-signal-safe according to POSIX.
    //
    // Therefore, it is safe to set getpid _as_ a signal handler.  It does nothing, exactly as we
    // want, and gets reset to SIG_DFL in subprocesses.  If we were a C program, we'd just define a
    // no-op function of the correct signature to use as a handler, but we're using JNA, and while
    // JNA does have the ability to C function pointer to a Java function, it cannot create an
    // async-signal-safe C function, since calls into Java are inherently signal-unsafe.
    //
    // [1] Win32 32-bit x86 stdcall is an exception to this general rule --- because the callee
    //      cleans up its stack --- but we don't run this code on Windows.
