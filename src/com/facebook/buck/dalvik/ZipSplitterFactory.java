  /**
   * Both combines and splits a set of input files into zip files such that no one output zip file
   * has entries that in total exceed {@code zipSizeHardLimit}. Input files can be themselves zip
   * files, individual class/resource files, or a directory of such of files. The inputs are
   * "opened", and the files contained within them are individually processed.
   *
   * <p>For example, given a set of inFiles of A.zip and B.zip where A.zip contains { A, B, C }, and
   * B.zip contains { X, Y, Z }, a possible outcome of this method could yield outPrimary.zip
   * containing { A, B }, outSecondary1.zip containing { C, X }, and outSecondary2.zip containing {
   * Y, Z }.
   *
   * <p>This method exists as a critical utility to divide source code so large that dx/dexopt fail
   * due to design constraints.
   *
   * @param inFiles Set of input files (directories or zip files) whose contents should be placed in
   *     the output zip files.
   * @param outPrimary Primary output zip file.
   * @param outSecondaryDir Directory to place secondary output zip files (if any are generated).
   * @param secondaryPattern Pattern containing a single integer (%d) that forms the filename of
   *     output zip files placed in {@code outSecondaryDir}.
   * @param requiredInPrimaryZip Determine which input <em>entries</em> are necessary in the primary
   *     output zip file. Note that this is referring to the entries contained within {@code
   *     inFiles}, not the input files themselves.
   * @param secondaryHeadSet list of classes to include in the primary dex until it is full
   * @param secondaryTailSet list of classes to include last in the secondary dex
   * @param additionalDexStores mapping of APKModules to module names for creating additional dex
   *     stores beyond the primary and secondary dex
   * @param apkModuleGraph the graph of APK Modules used for associating classes with additional dex
   *     stores beyond the primary and secondary dexes.
   * @param canaryStrategy Determine whether to include canary classes for easy verification.
   * @param reportDir Directory where to publish a report of which classes were written to which zip
   *     files with a corresponding size estimate.
