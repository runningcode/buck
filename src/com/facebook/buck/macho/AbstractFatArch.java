/**
 * This header file describes the structures of the file format for "fat" architecture specific file
 * (wrapper design). At the begining of the file there is one fat_header structure followed by a
 * number of fat_arch structures. For each architecture in the file, specified by a pair of cputype
 * and cpusubtype, the fat_header describes the file offset, file size and alignment in the file of
 * the architecture specific member. The padded bytes in the file to place each member on it's
 * specific alignment are defined to be read as zeros and can be left as "holes" if the file system
 * can support them as long as they read as zeros.
 *
 * <p>All structures defined here are always written and read to/from disk in big-endian order.
