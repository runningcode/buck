   * This Buildable is expected to support the GWT flavor, which is a {@link BuildRule} whose output
   * file is a JAR containing the files necessary to use this {@link JavaLibrary} as a GWT module.
   * Normally, this includes Java source code, a .gwt.xml file, and static resources, such as
   * stylesheets and image files.
   *
   * <p>In the event that this {@link JavaLibrary} cannot be represented as a GWT module (for
   * example, if it has no {@code srcs} or {@code resources} of its own, but only exists to export
   * deps), then the flavor will be {@link Optional#empty()}.
   *
   * <p>Note that the output of the {@link BuildRule} for this flavor may contain {@code .class}
   * files. For example, if a third-party releases its {@code .class} and {@code .java} files in the
   * same JAR, it is common for a {@code prebuilt_jar()} to declare that file as both its {@code
   * binary_jar} and its {@code source_jar}. In that case, the output of the {@link BuildRule} will
   * be the original JAR file, which is why it would contain {@code .class} files.
