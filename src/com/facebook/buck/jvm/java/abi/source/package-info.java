/**
 * Enables generation of ABI jars using only the Java source code of a single target, without
 * requiring access to the source or ABI of dependencies.
 *
 * <p>If the ABI of a dependency target is available, it will be used. However, when one or more
 * dependency ABIs are missing, certain language constructs become ambiguous, and we have to make
 * assumptions. Most of those assumptions can be worked around with small changes to coding style.
 *
 * <p>See {@link com.facebook.buck.jvm.java.abi.source.InterfaceValidator} for more information on
