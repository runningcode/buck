/**
 * A {@link JavacPhaseTracer} that translates the trace data to be more useful.
 *
 * <p>The phases of compilation are described <a
 * href="http://openjdk.java.net/groups/compiler/doc/compilation-overview/index.html">here</a>. The
 * doc describes annotation processing as conceptually occuring before compilation, but actually
 * occurring somewhat out-of-phase with the conceptual model.
 *
 * <p>Javac calls {@link TracingTaskListener} according to the conceptual model described in that
 * document: annotation processing starts at the very beginning of the run, and ends after the last
 * annotation processor is run in the last round of processing. Then there is one last parse and
 * enter before going into analyze and generate. This is problematic from a performance perspective,
 * because some of the work attributed to annotation processing would have happened regardless.
 *
 * <p>This class translates the tracing data from the conceptual model back into something that more
 * closely matches the actual implementation:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Parse, enter, analyze, and generate phases pass thru unchanged
 *   <li>What javac traces as an annotation processing round is renamed "run annotation processors"
 *   <li>Annotation processing rounds are traced from the beginning of "run annotation processors"
 *       to the beginning of the next "run annotation processors" or (for the last round) the first
 *       analyze phase
 *   <li>Annotation processing is traced from the beginning of the first round to the end of the
 *       last
 *   <li>If compilation ends during annotation processing (as can happen with -proc:only), it
 *       detects this (via being closed by its caller) and emits appropriate tracing
 * </ul>
 *
 * In this way, the time attributed to annotation processing is always time that would not have been
 * spent if annotation processors were not present.
